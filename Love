a sustinable solution is purchase dying plants
cure it
when is done sell it at the cost with no premium earning.

in my learned philosphy of management, i feel like a tiny incentive for profit is where things might get blow up out of proportion.
simple term 1/0.00000000001 is going to be huge profit, but if the accumulation process happen fast, is similar to cancer.
therefore, is not recommended. 

in this model, you might not able to save the plant, then you are not going to get pay.
if you are ill and you got treated at the hospital, and you were death. who is going to pay the bill?
in this perspective it also is not a sustinable solution.
but the whole point is you choose to save rather to let it die.

was it worth it? in the act of love?
you can wait for it propergate from the saved one and offset the cost of the unable saved one?
but thats asking other kid to pay for your own desire in the name of love.

if other kid do desire to save the plant the cost is cut by half,quarter and so far... 
but it shouldnt be driven by the incentive of love?

if you take death is greater than birth, meaning death rate of all things is faster than the birth rate, then it might be a okay perspective to take the bullet that you know is about losing and not winning in the act of love.
my chat with a prof at PsU , she said the universe is expand at a faster rate, in that sense maybe there is invisible convertion in the equation. but is the very fundamental was is life? is expanded universe is a force of life?
